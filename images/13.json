We want to make your experience on  the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the  Internet&#8217;s vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete  confidence.<\/p>\n<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment  to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects  information from all end users of our Internet services (the  &#8220;Services&#8221;)-those who access some of our Services but do not have  accounts (&#8220;Visitors&#8221;) as well as those who may purchase Products  and\/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service  (&#8220;Members&#8221;)-what we do with the information we collect, and the  choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such  information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How  It Is Used<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Introduction: Our company collects information in different ways from  Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the  network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information  primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Products and  Services, and generally, do not share this information with third parties.  However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received  your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we  believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases  described below.<\/p>\n<p>Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal  information when they sign up for our Products or Services including name,  address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number),  and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The  personal information collected from Members during the registration process is  used to manage each Member&#8217;s account (such as for billing purposes). This  information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated  otherwise or in special circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote  our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such as  the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a  result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the  partner to assess the results of the promotion.<\/p>\n<p>In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner  for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate  profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as  the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail  below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell  advertisements that appear on the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may be  offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent  contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members  some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and  maintain personal information. In these instances, you will be notified before  any such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to use that  particular service or feature.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web  Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor seller, or  non-affiliated partner. Our company may share non-identifying and aggregate  information (except as described above), but not personal information, with  such partners in order to administer the co-branded products or services  offered.<\/p>\n<p>Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and  services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new  product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact  information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and  credit\/debit card information.<\/p>\n<p>If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order  sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the  recipient, such as the recipient&#8217;s name, address, and phone number. Our company  has no control over the third parties&#8217; use of any personal information you  provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.<\/p>\n<p>If you order services or products directly from our company we will use  the personal information you provide only to process that order. We do not  share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to  complete that order.<\/p>\n<p>Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online  advertisements. In those cases we share aggregated and non-identifying  information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration  process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these  advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and  non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint  ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the  audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the  audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have  collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended  audience. Our company does not share personal information about its Visitors or  Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.<\/p>\n<p>Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email  inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the email  inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return email address for any  other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.<\/p>\n<p>Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business  and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in  these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us  to improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them  to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly  confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation  in our customer surveys is voluntary.<\/p>\n<p>We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to  our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other  customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey  questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment,  industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated  information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new  services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information  may be shared with third parties.<\/p>\n<p>Promotions: Our company may offer polls, contests, sweepstakes,  drawings, games, content, or other promotions that are sponsored by or  cobranded with third parties. In certain instances, company may have to supply  personally identifiable information of the winners to the third parties. Our  company has no control over third parties&#8217; use of this information.<\/p>\n<p>You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, simply  by making a purchase from us or by providing us with personally identifiable  information for some other reason or purpose. When the winning entries are  chosen, only the names and personally identifiable information of the winners  are shared with the entity administering the sweepstakes or contest, so that  they can notify the winners.<\/p>\n<p>Special Cases: It is our company&#8217;s policy not to use or share the  personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones  described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or  otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.<\/p>\n<p>However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members,  or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible  through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe  that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, collection  agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such  as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act,  regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to  disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal  action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms  Of Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to  protect our company and our Members.<\/p>\n<p>Notice of Compliance to California Residents &#8211; Your California Privacy  Rights Under The California Online Privacy Protection Act and the California  Business and Professions Code<\/p>\n<p>This privacy policy identifies the categories of personally identifiable  information that our company collects through our Web site or online service,  about individual consumers who use or visit our company&#8217;s commercial Web site  or online service and the categories of third-party persons or entities with  whom our company may share that personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>Our company does not maintain a process for an individual consumer who  uses or visits our commercial Web site or online service to review and request  changes to any of his or her personally identifiable information that is  collected through our Web site or online service.<\/p>\n<p>See the section below entitled &#8220;Revisions To This Policy&#8221; for  a description of the process by which our company notifies consumers who use or  visit our commercial Web site or online service of material changes to our  company&#8217;s privacy policy for this Web site or online service.<\/p>\n<p>The effective date of this privacy policy is listed at the end of this  privacy policy under the heading, &#8220;Last updated.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For the purposes of this policy and California compliance the following  definitions apply:<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the visitor&#8217;s activity, in our commercial Web site or  online service, the following &#8220;personally identifiable information&#8221;  may be collected, in addition to information set forth in other sections of  this document.<\/p>\n<p>The term &#8220;personally identifiable information&#8221; means  individually identifiable information about an individual consumer collected  online by our company from an individual and maintained by our company in an  accessible form, and may include any of the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A first and last name.<\/li>\n<li>A home or other physical address, including street name and name of a city       or town.<\/li>\n<li>An e-mail address.<\/li>\n<li>A telephone number.<\/li>\n<li>A social security number.<\/li>\n<li>Any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a       specific individual.<\/li>\n<li>Information concerning a user that the Web site or online service collects       online, from the user, and maintains in personally identifiable form, in       combination with an identifier described within this privacy policy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Under California Law SB 27, California residents have the right to  receive, once a year, information about third parties with whom we have shared  information about you or your family for their marketing purposes during the  previous calendar year, if any, and a description of the categories of personal  information shared.
